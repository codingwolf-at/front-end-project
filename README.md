# front-end-project
This is the front end of an e-commerce website named as Lifestyle Store created using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
Consider this as my first attempt of an e-commerce website using Bootstrap 3 (it has no back-end).
My second attempt is also on this account where I used Bootstrap 4, you can find it [HERE](https://github.com/codingwolf-at/e-marketplace)
